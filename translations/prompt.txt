   * If there's a title to translate, return it on the first line, followed by two newlines, then the content
   * Maintain exactly the same line breaks and spacing as the original
* Do not translate:
   - File paths or links in [[double brackets]]
   - Code blocks or inline code
   - Image URLs or paths
   - Citations in [@citation] format
   - Technical medical terms that should remain in their standard form
   - Brand names of medications
   - Emojis
* Preserve any HTML tags or special formatting

Aim for a natural, professional medical translation that maintains the technical accuracy of the original content while being accessible to healthcare professionals in the target language.
